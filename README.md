# About this project
```REACT-SERIES-PROJECT-04(2022)```

 In web design, an accordion is a type of menu that displays a list of headers stacked on top of one another.


# Purpose of this project
This project is part of my React learning process from the scratch. This is a very simple project to help me brush up on my skills and prerequisite knowledge before diving into a large real-world application. The complexity of the react projects in this repository will grow as the days pass.
